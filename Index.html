                Hi there! Leelai is a 23, I'm a recent alumni from Florida Intitute of Technology. Having been exposed to Project Lead the Way (PLTW) in highschool and Anne Arundel Community College (AACC) her career path was heavily influenced towards engineering. With accomplishing a bachelors Mechanical Engineering degree she moved from Florida to Pennsylvania. Still seeking to become more well rounded in her knowledge of tech, she started a web development bootcamp through Penn-State. Aside from engineering she has been studying Japanese since 2012 and hobbies such as anime,video gaming, and book-worming.This portfolio will expand as her knowledge grows and this will be the main hub to express those attributes.
