# Leelai Hayslett's Portfolio

## Portfolio info
 ```
This portfolio showcases all of the applications that Leelai has created through the LPS Penn web-developing program. As my knowledge expands the website application will be more interactive and expressive of who I am as a developer. I hope to convert my web-development skills to software development and eventually game development. Thank you for taking the time to watch my portfolio progression!

## Progression notes
```
Just so that is stated. No piece purely copied without my own modification but with the aid of W3Schools, a lot of the issues I ran into were fixed. That being said I could not figure out why my one paragraph kept overlapping into my next section section.
